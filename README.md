# <!-- Getting started with --> API

Most of MeteoSwiss's Open Data will become available via the [OGC API - Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) of the [Federal Spatial Data Infrastructure (FSDI)](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/federal-spatial-data-infrastructure-fsdi).

For data with three dimensions, MeteoSwiss wants to enable access via [OGC API - EDR](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/edr/) capable interfaces.

Both projects are currently in the concept phase.



<!-- Our API's follow the OGC API - features standard to make it as easy as possible to use existing tools to work with our data. Even if your favorite tools do not support OGC API - features directly, it builds upon well known standards such as OpenAPI and GeoJSON which are generally well supported.

If you are already familiar with REST API's, you should probably go to the page for the API that contains the data you are interrested in and use the swagger link to test and get help with the type of requests you can make.

If not, you should probably start by looking at the Query primer page. When you have read and understood that, go to API page for the service and see the 'Query parameters' section to learn how to use the API of your choice. The exact structure of a response is also shown on that page.

You can also find guides, examples and packages/libraries made by other users by going to Third-party Examples. Be aware that DMI does not support or provide any guarantees on the content found under user application examples. -->
